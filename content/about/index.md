An undergraduate student in Computer Science at UNICAMP who dreams too much and tries to do everything in so little time. I <img src="/img/heart2.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 16px;"/> my area!

I'm researching about deep learning, currently working with both computer vision and reinforcement learning. I also like to develop games in my free time.

My past interests include embedded parallel systems, which I've worked on for over a year along with ARM architecture and Intel OpenMP* Runtime. I've also helped to create [Doe Nota], an awesome app which allows people to easily donate receipts to non-governmental organization.

I'm also interested in the wildlife cause and I have worked on as a volunteer at [Wildlife Act] in the past, which was an incredible experience.
